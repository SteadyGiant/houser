Description: The US Census Bureau conducts quite a few surveys of buildings and
    housing in the US (see <https://www.census.gov/econ/construction.html>).
    None of this data is available in the official Census API
    (<https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html>). This package 
    provides a convenient way to access housing data from the US Census.
